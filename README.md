## Smart Parking in Toronto

### Project Overview

<p align="justify">
 Parking problem is one of the biggest issues faced by metropoles. According to IBM global survey, around 30% of the traffic in large cities downtown areas is caused by cars searching for parking, and it takes individual cars almost 8 minutes (7.8 minutes) to find a free parking spot. With constant growing population in Toronto (2.8 million in 2016, and in GTA (Greater Toronto Area) with a growth rate of around 1.5% annually, Toronto presents no exception when looking at parking problems. Higher amount of time spent on searching for parking leads not only to traffic congestion as mentionned above, but also lead to additional consumption of fuel, as well as safety issues and increased stress.

Given these observations, the main problem we would like to solve is how to help municipalities optimize parking in Toronto. It can be done by
</p>
<p align="justify">
1. Reducing parking time of the vehicles at an individual level, or
</p>
<p align="justify">
2. Finding optimal areas to place new parking locations.
</p>
<p align="justify">
We therefore decided to split the problem into two main parts, one for individual vehicles and one for general organization of the city.
</p>
<p align="justify">
  I<b>ndividual vehicles: </b> it would be interesting to look at how parking time could be optimized. We want to identify free parking spots, and provide an optimal route for vehicles looking for parking by defining and optimizing our own "distance" metric.
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <b> General organization: </b> we want to see if we can place new facilities to save parking time for vehicles. We want to identify locations where the vehicles spend most time in before finding a parking spot, and look closer at how vehicle movement is different in different neighborhoods.
